# Design Layout
Looking at the image

There are three main areas: The dashboard side bar; The header with several buttons and a search bar; the content page-which has two subsections(Projects and Announcments). The general approach will be to use grid to create cells for these main sections. The inner content of each section will either use grid or flex box to separate content.
